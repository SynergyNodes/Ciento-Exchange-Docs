# Brige CNTO from Acrechain Mainnet to Base Mainnet

NOTE: You can only brige CNTO tokens. To bride other tokens such as USDC, you will need to convert them to Cosmos IBC tokens and bridge through other bridges like Axelar, etc.

Please make sure that you convert your CNTO to ERC20 using https://app.arable.finance/#/ibc

If you are having CNTO on other chains such as Osmosis, please transfer them to Acrechain, convert them to ERC20 token and then follow these steps below.

1. Visit [Ciento.exchnage](https://ciento.exchange/)
2. Connect Metamask Wallet
3. Select Acrechain Mainnet in Metamask
4. Click on "All Links" Menu
5. Click on "Bridge" Link
6. Approve CNTO
7. Deposit CNTO to the bridge by clicking on "Submit"
8. The Deposited CNTO on Acrechain will be burnt.

You can bridge a maximum of 10,000 CNTO at a time. We will process the bridge transactions once every 10 minutes and we will send you 2x amount of CNTO to the same address on Base Mainnet.
